The traing and validation set doesn't have much frames that have any scratches,
reason of that is simply because the cropping algorithm crops from the entire frame while only 
limited regions contain scratches.

This makes the validation loss even lower than training loss because most of predtions are negative.

TODO:
	1. Should improve the cropping algorithm so that the vertical assembled frames are cropped from
	    scratched area.
	2. Might be a good idea to increase the size of training and validation set.
